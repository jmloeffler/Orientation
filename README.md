# Orientation

A 2D platformer game in which nothing is constant...not even gravity.  Created in GameMaker, this game builds upon inspiration I gained from STL GameJam 2015.

### Gameplay
Use the arrow keys to move your character.  Use the space bar to jump.  The meters in the upper left show how many orbs you have and how long until the next warp.  When a warp occurs, gravity may change directions on you and/or your controls may become inverted.  You can use an orb that you have collected to force a warp by pressing the shift key.  Your goal is to make it to the exit and safely back to your gravity-controlled ship.
